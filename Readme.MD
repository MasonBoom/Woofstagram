# Woofstagram

This is my first application that was created using a JavaScript framework called React Native, and my first mobile application I have designed. This project was developed throughout Codecademy's "Learn React Native" skill path. I have combined all of the projects within Codecademy's skill path to create an instagram clone for dogs called Woofstagram. I have also separated each component into separate files for organization purposes.

Throughout this project, I have learned about core components, navigation, and styling with React-Native.
