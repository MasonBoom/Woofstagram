# Woofstagram

This is my first application that was created using a JavaScript framework called React Native, and my first mobile application I have designed. This project was developed throughout Codecademy's "Learn React Native" skill path. I have combined all of the projects within Codecademy's skill path to create an instagram clone for dogs called Woofstagram. I have also separated each component into separate files for organization purposes.

Throughout this project, I have learned about core components, navigation, and styling with React-Native.

To run this project on your local machine:

- Download zip file
- Open your terminal and type "expo start" in the main directory
- Open the web preview from the dev tools
- To run this app on a mobile device, you must have "Expo go" installed on your device. Use your phone camera and scan the QR code while it is running
